Measurements of Physiological Parameters in Flight Simulator Studies for Stress Detection and Analysis Through Deep Learning Applications

This project has been created over the course of the Master's Thesis at the Institute of Aircraft Systems at University of Stuttgart in cooperation with the Institute of Flight Guidance at the DLR in Brunswick, Germany. 

## Flight Simulator Studies
There have been two flight simulator studies in the AVES flight simulator.
The first, by Mr. C. Booms, to investigate Single Pilot Operation was used to measure physilogical data in the background.
The second study, Limits of Human Performance (LoHP) was designed to even furter trigger and more closely monitoring stress reactions.
